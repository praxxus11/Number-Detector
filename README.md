## Jupiter Notebook
I used 10,000 images from the MNIST database to train it. These were supposed to be the test images, but I didn't want to download 100,000 images which used up 100 mb.
The notebook contains the code to find the parameters. The parameters are within the BETTERPARAM.txt file. There are 20535 parameters with input layer 784, two hidden layers of 25 each and a output layer of 10.
