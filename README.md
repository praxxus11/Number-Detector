# Number-Detector
UPDATE!! YOU CAN NOW TRY THIS AT https://praxxus11.github.io/ericsite/num_rec.html WRITTEN IN JS
## Jupiter Notebook
I used 10,000 images from the MNIST database to train the detector. These were supposed to be the test images, but I didn't want to download 60,000 which used up 100mb of storage.
The notebook contains the code to find the parameters which are within the BETTERPARAM.txt file. There are 20535 parameters with input layer 784, two hidden layers of 25 each and a output layer of 10. You can easily configure the layers and nodes in each layer by changing the layers tuple.
